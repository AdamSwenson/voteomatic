<h1>The Voteomatic</h1>

## WHATIS

The Voteomatic helps academic senates and other deliberative bodies do their work. 

## Features

- Allows members to authenticate through the LTI interface of learning management systems. No creating passwords or figuring out who is a member. Just put all members in a Canvas/Moodle/etc course. 

- Basic parliamentary procedure built in from the ground up.

- Easy export of the motion tree to aid in compiling meeting minutes.


## Installation

The voteomatic is built on the Laravel framework. Installation is just a matter of pulling the repository onto a server, creating a MySQL database, and running migrations. More details forthcoming.
